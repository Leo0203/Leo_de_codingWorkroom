## 📂 Repository Overview

This repository contains multiple independent projects and learning modules, including:

### 🧠 Core Programming & CS Foundations
- **C_learning** – Practice with pointers, memory, structures, functions, and low-level programming  
- **C++_learning** – Object-oriented programming, arrays, references, data structures  
- **Java_learning** – Java syntax, OOP concepts, basic applications  
- **DS101_IntrToRLanguage** – R programming and data visualization coursework  
- **MatLab** – Numerical computing and technical exploration using MATLAB  

### 🌐 Web & Software Development
- **html_learning** – Front-end fundamentals (HTML/CSS structure practice)  
- **JS_learning/SNAKE** – JavaScript-based Snake game demonstrating DOM interaction and game logic  

### 🎮 Embedded & Hardware-Software Integration
- **wrackAMole** – Recreated the classic *Whack-a-Mole* game using Arduino, combining:
  - Microcontroller programming  
  - Physical input/output  
  - Real-time interaction  
  - Hardware debugging  

This project reflects my interest in embedded systems and low-level interaction between software and hardware.
