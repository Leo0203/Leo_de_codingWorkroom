### 1. Array

Arrays is a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.

Instead of declaring individual variables, such as number0, number1, ..., and number99, you declare one array variable such as numbers and use numbers[0], numbers[1], and ..., numbers[99] to represent individual variables. A specific element in an array is accessed by an index.

All arrays consist of contiguous memory locations. The lowest address corresponds to the first element and the highest address to the last element.

#### Declaring Arrays

To declare an array in C, a programmer specifies the type of the elements and the number of elements required by an array as follows:

```c
type arrayName [ arraySize ];
```

This is called a single-dimensional array. The arraySize must be an integer constant greater than zero and type can be any valid C data type. For example, to declare a 10-element array called balance of type double, use this statement:

```c
double balance[10];
```

Here balance is a variable array which is sufficient to hold up to 10 double numbers.

#### Initializing Arrays

You can initialize an array in C either one by one or using a single statement as follows:

```c
double balance[5] = {1000.0, 2.0, 3.4, 7.0, 50.0};
```

The number of values between braces { } cannot be larger than the number of elements that we declare for the array between square brackets [ ].

If you omit the size of the array, an array just big enough to hold the initialization is created. Therefore, if you write:

```c
double balance[] = {1000.0, 2.0, 3.4, 7.0, 50.0};
```

You will create exactly the same array as you did in the previous example. Following is an example to assign a single element of the array: 

```c
balance[4] = 50.0;
```

The above statement assigns the 5th element in the array with a value of 50.0. All arrays have 0 as the index of their first element which is also called the base index and the last index of an array will be total size of the array minus 1

#### Accessing Array Elements

An element is accessed by indexing the array name. This is done by placing the index of the element within square brackets after the name of the array.

```c
double salary = balance[9];
```

The above statement will take the 10th element from the array and assign the value to salary variable. The following example Shows how to use all the three above mentioned concepts viz. declaration, assignment, and accessing arrays

Example: 
```c
#include <stdio.h>
 
int main () {

   int n[ 10 ]; /* n is an array of 10 integers */
   int i,j;
 
   /* initialize elements of array n to 0 */         
   for ( i = 0; i < 10; i++ ) {
      n[ i ] = i + 100; /* set element at location i to i + 100 */
   }
   
   /* output each array element's value */
   for (j = 0; j < 10; j++ ) {
      printf("Element[%d] = %d\n", j, n[j] );
   }
 
   return 0;
}
```

#### Multi-dimensional Arrays in C

C programming language allows multidimensional arrays. Here is the general form of a multidimensional array declaration:

```c
type name[size1][size2]...[sizeN];
```

For example, the following declaration creates a three dimensional integer array:

```c
int threedim[5][10][4];
```

#### Two-dimensional Arrays

The simplest form of multidimensional array is the two-dimensional array. A two-dimensional array is, in essence, a list of one-dimensional arrays. To declare a two-dimensional integer array of size [x][y], you would write something as follows:

```c
type arrayName [ x ][ y ];
```

Where `type` can be any valid C data type and `arrayName` will be a valid C identifier. A two-dimensional array can be considered as a table which will have x number of rows and y number of columns

#### Initializing Two-dimensional arrays

Multidimensional arrays may be initialized by specifying bracketed values for each row. Following is an array with 3 rows and each row has 4 columns.

```c
int a[3][4] = {  
   {0, 1, 2, 3} ,   /*  initializers for row indexed by 0 */
   {4, 5, 6, 7} ,   /*  initializers for row indexed by 1 */
   {8, 9, 10, 11}   /*  initializers for row indexed by 2 */
};
```

The nested braces, which indicate the intended row, are optional. The following initialization is equivalent to the previous example:

```c
int a[3][4] = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11};
```

#### Accesing Two-dimensional Array elements

An element in a two-dimensional array is accessed by using the subscripts, i.e., row index and column index of the array.

```c
int val = a[2][3];
```

The above statement will take the 4th element from the 3rd row of the array. You can verify it in the above figure. Let us check the following program where we have used a nested loop to handle a two-dimensional array:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
 
int main () {

   /* an array with 5 rows and 2 columns*/
   int a[5][2] = { {0,0}, {1,2}, {2,4}, {3,6},{4,8}};
   int i, j;
 
   /* output each array element's value */
   for ( i = 0; i < 5; i++ ) {

      for ( j = 0; j < 2; j++ ) {
         printf("a[%d][%d] = %d\n", i,j, a[i][j] );
      }
   }
   
   return 0;
}
```

#### Passing Arrays as Function Arguments in C

If you want to pass a single-dimension array as an argument in a function, you would have to declare a formal parameter in one of following three ways and all three declaration methods produce similar results because each tells the compiler that an integer pointer is going to be received. Similarly, you can pass multi-dimensional arrays as formal parameters.

#### Method 1: Formal parameters as pointer

```c
void myFunction(int *param){

}
```

#### Method 2: Formal parameters as sized array

```c
void myFunction(int param[10]) {

}
```

#### Method 3: Formal parameters as an unsized array

```c
void myFunction(int param[]) {

}
```

Example: 
```c
double getAverage(int arr[], int size) {

   int i;
   double avg;
   double sum = 0;

   for (i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
      sum += arr[i];
   }

   avg = sum / size;

   return avg;
}
```

```c
#include <stdio.h>
 
/* function declaration */
double getAverage(int arr[], int size);

int main () {

   /* an int array with 5 elements */
   int balance[5] = {1000, 2, 3, 17, 50};
   double avg;

   /* pass pointer to the array as an argument */
   avg = getAverage( balance, 5 ) ;
 
   /* output the returned value */
   printf( "Average value is: %f ", avg );
    
   return 0;
}
```

Result:
```c
Average value is: 214.400000
```

#### Return array from a function

C programming does not allow to return an entire array as an argument to a function. However, you can return a pointer to an array by specifying the array's name without an index.

If you want to return a single-dimension array from a function, you would have to declare a function returning a pointer as in the following example: 

```c
int * myFunction() {

}
```

Second point to remember is that C does not advocate to return the address of a local variable to outside of the function, so you would have to define the local variable as `static` variable.

Now, consider the following function which will generate 10 random numbers and return them using an array and call this function as follows:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

/* function to generate and return random numbers */
int * getRandom( ) {

   static int  r[10];
   int i;

   /* set the seed */
   srand( (unsigned)time( NULL ) );
  
   for ( i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
      r[i] = rand();
      printf( "r[%d] = %d\n", i, r[i]);
   }

   return r;
}

/* main function to call above defined function */
int main () {

   /* a pointer to an int */
   int *p;
   int i;

   p = getRandom();

   for ( i = 0; i < 10; i++ ) {
      printf( "*(p + %d) : %d\n", i, *(p + i));
   }

   return 0;
}
```

### 2.Pointers

Pointers in C are easy and fun to learn. Some C programming tasks are performed more easily with pointers, and other tasks, such as dynamic memory allocation, cannot be performed without using pointers. So it becomes necessary to learn pointers to become a perfect C programmer. Let's start learning them in simple and easy steps.

As you know, every variable is a memory location and every memory location has its address defined which can be accessed using ampersand (&) operator, which denotes an address in memory. Consider the following example, which prints the address of the variables defined:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main () {

   int  var1;
   char var2[10];

   printf("Address of var1 variable: %x\n", &var1  );
   printf("Address of var2 variable: %x\n", &var2  );

   return 0;
}
```

Result:
```c
Address of var1 variable: bff5a400
Address of var2 variable: bff5a3f6
```

#### What are pointers?

A `pointer` is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., direct address of the memory location. Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before using it to store any variable address. The general form of a pointer variable declaration is:

```c
type *var-name;
```

Here, `type` is the pointer's base type; it must be a valid C data type and var-name is the name of the pointer variable. The asterisk * used to declare a pointer is the same asterisk used for multiplication. However, in this statement the asterisk is being used to designate a variable as a pointer.

```c
int    *ip;    /* pointer to an integer */
double *dp;    /* pointer to a double */
float  *fp;    /* pointer to a float */
char   *ch     /* pointer to a character */
```

The actual data type of the value of all pointers, whether integer, float, character, or otherwise, is the same, a long hexadecimal number that represents a memory address. The only difference between pointers of different data types is the data type of the variable or constant that the pointer points to.

#### How to use pointers?

There are a few important operations, which we will do with the help of pointers very frequently:
- (a) We define a pointer variable
- (b) assign the address of a variable to a pointer  
- (c) finally access the value at the address available in the pointer variable. This is done by using unary operator * that returns the value of the variable located at the address specified by its operand.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main () {

   int  var = 20;   /* actual variable declaration */
   int  *ip;        /* pointer variable declaration */

   ip = &var;  /* store address of var in pointer variable*/

   printf("Address of var variable: %x\n", &var  );

   /* address stored in pointer variable */
   printf("Address stored in ip variable: %x\n", ip );

   /* access the value using the pointer */
   printf("Value of *ip variable: %d\n", *ip );

   return 0;
}
```

Result:
```c
Address of var variable: bffd8b3c
Address stored in ip variable: bffd8b3c
Value of *ip variable: 20
```

#### NULL Pointers

It is always a good practice to assign a `NULL` value to a pointer variable in case you do not have an exact address to be assigned. This is done at the time of variable declaration. A pointer that is assigned `NULL` is called a `null` pointer.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main () {

   int  *ptr = NULL;

   printf("The value of ptr is : %x\n", ptr  );

   return 0;
}
```

Result:
```c
The value of ptr is 0
```

In most of the operating systems, programs are not permitted to access memory at address 0 because that memory is reserved by the operating system. However, the memory address 0 has special significance; it signals that the pointer is not intended to point to an accessible memory location. But by convention, if a pointer contains the null (zero) value, it is assumed to point to nothing.

To check for a null pointer, you can use an 'if' statement:
```c
if(ptr)     /* succeeds if p is not null */
if(!ptr)    /* succeeds if p is null */
```
