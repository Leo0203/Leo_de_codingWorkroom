## 1. Function Arguments

If a function is to use `arguments`, it must declare variables that accept the values of the `arguments`. These variables are called the `formal parameters` of the function.

`Formal parameters` behave like other `local variables` inside the function and are created upon entry into the function and destroyed upon exit.

While calling a function, there are two ways in which arguments can be passed to a function:

|  Sr.No. |  Call Type & Description |
|:----------:|:-------------:|
|1|call by value, This method copies the actual value of an argument into the formal parameter of the function. In this case, changes made to the parameter inside the function have no effect on the argument|
|2|call by reference, This method copies the address of an argument into the formal parameter. Inside the function, the address is used to access the actual argument used in the call. This means that changes made to the parameter affect the argument|

### Formal Parameter

Formal parameters, are treated as local variables with-in a function and they take precedence over global variables.

Example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
 
/* global variable declaration */
int a = 20;
 
int main () {

  /* local variable declaration in main function */
  int a = 10;
  int b = 20;
  int c = 0;

  printf ("value of a in main() = %d\n",  a);
  c = sum( a, b);
  printf ("value of c in main() = %d\n",  c);

  return 0;
}

/* function to add two integers */
int sum(int a, int b) {

   printf ("value of a in sum() = %d\n",  a);
   printf ("value of b in sum() = %d\n",  b);

   return a + b;
}
```

### Call By Value

The `call by value` method of passing arguments to a function copies the actual value of an argument into the formal parameter of the function. In this case, changes made to the parameter inside the function have no effect on the argument.

By default, C programming uses `call by value` to pass arguments. In general, it means the code within a function cannot alter the arguments used to call the function. Consider the function `swap()` definition as follows.

Example:
```c
/* function definition to swap the values */
void swap(int x, int y) {

   int temp;

   temp = x; /* save the value of x */
   x = y;    /* put y into x */
   y = temp; /* put temp into y */
  
   return;
}
```

Now, let us call the function swap() by passing actual values as in the following example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
 
/* function declaration */
void swap(int x, int y);
int main () {

   /* local variable definition */
   int a = 100;
   int b = 200;
 
   printf("Before swap, value of a : %d\n", a );
   printf("Before swap, value of b : %d\n", b );
 
   /* calling a function to swap the values */
   swap(a, b);
 
   printf("After swap, value of a : %d\n", a );
   printf("After swap, value of b : %d\n", b );
 
   return 0;
}
```

### Call By Reference

The `call by reference` method of passing arguments to a function copies the address of an argument into the formal parameter. Inside the function, the address is used to access the actual argument used in the call. It means the changes made to the parameter affect the passed argument.

To pass a value by reference, argument pointers are passed to the functions just like any other value. So accordingly you need to declare the function parameters as pointer types as in the following function `swap()`, which exchanges the values of the two integer variables pointed to, by their arguments.

Example:
```c
/* function definition to swap the values */
void swap(int *x, int *y) {

   int temp;
   temp = *x;    /* save the value at address x */
   *x = *y;      /* put y into x */
   *y = temp;    /* put temp into y */
  
   return;
}
```

Let us now call the function swap() by passing value by reference as in the following example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
 
/* function declaration */
void swap(int *x, int *y);
 
int main () {

   /* local variable definition */
   int a = 100;
   int b = 200;
 
   printf("Before swap, value of a : %d\n", a );
   printf("Before swap, value of b : %d\n", b );
 
   /* calling a function to swap the values.
      * &a indicates pointer to a ie. address of variable a and 
      * &b indicates pointer to b ie. address of variable b.
   */
   swap(&a, &b);
 
   printf("After swap, value of a : %d\n", a );
   printf("After swap, value of b : %d\n", b );
 
   return 0;
}
```

## 2. Array

Arrays is a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.

Instead of declaring individual variables, such as number0, number1, ..., and number99, you declare one array variable such as numbers and use numbers[0], numbers[1], and ..., numbers[99] to represent individual variables. A specific element in an array is accessed by an index.

All arrays consist of contiguous memory locations. The lowest address corresponds to the first element and the highest address to the last element.

### Declaring Arrays

To declare an array in C, a programmer specifies the type of the elements and the number of elements required by an array as follows:

```c
type arrayName [ arraySize ];
```

This is called a single-dimensional array. The arraySize must be an integer constant greater than zero and type can be any valid C data type. For example, to declare a 10-element array called balance of type double, use this statement:

```c
double balance[10];
```

Here balance is a variable array which is sufficient to hold up to 10 double numbers.

### Initializing Arrays

You can initialize an array in C either one by one or using a single statement as follows:

```c
double balance[5] = {1000.0, 2.0, 3.4, 7.0, 50.0};
```

The number of values between braces { } cannot be larger than the number of elements that we declare for the array between square brackets [ ].

If you omit the size of the array, an array just big enough to hold the initialization is created. Therefore, if you write:

```c
double balance[] = {1000.0, 2.0, 3.4, 7.0, 50.0};
```

You will create exactly the same array as you did in the previous example. Following is an example to assign a single element of the array: 

```c
balance[4] = 50.0;
```

The above statement assigns the 5th element in the array with a value of 50.0. All arrays have 0 as the index of their first element which is also called the base index and the last index of an array will be total size of the array minus 1

### Accessing Array Elements

An element is accessed by indexing the array name. This is done by placing the index of the element within square brackets after the name of the array.

```c
double salary = balance[9];
```

The above statement will take the 10th element from the array and assign the value to salary variable. The following example Shows how to use all the three above mentioned concepts viz. declaration, assignment, and accessing arrays

Example: 
```c
#include <stdio.h>
 
int main () {

   int n[ 10 ]; /* n is an array of 10 integers */
   int i,j;
 
   /* initialize elements of array n to 0 */         
   for ( i = 0; i < 10; i++ ) {
      n[ i ] = i + 100; /* set element at location i to i + 100 */
   }
   
   /* output each array element's value */
   for (j = 0; j < 10; j++ ) {
      printf("Element[%d] = %d\n", j, n[j] );
   }
 
   return 0;
}
```

### Multi-dimensional Arrays in C

C programming language allows multidimensional arrays. Here is the general form of a multidimensional array declaration:

```c
type name[size1][size2]...[sizeN];
```

For example, the following declaration creates a three dimensional integer array:

```c
int threedim[5][10][4];
```

### Two-dimensional Arrays

The simplest form of multidimensional array is the two-dimensional array. A two-dimensional array is, in essence, a list of one-dimensional arrays. To declare a two-dimensional integer array of size [x][y], you would write something as follows:

```c
type arrayName [ x ][ y ];
```

Where `type` can be any valid C data type and `arrayName` will be a valid C identifier. A two-dimensional array can be considered as a table which will have x number of rows and y number of columns

### Initializing Two-dimensional arrays

Multidimensional arrays may be initialized by specifying bracketed values for each row. Following is an array with 3 rows and each row has 4 columns.

```c
int a[3][4] = {  
   {0, 1, 2, 3} ,   /*  initializers for row indexed by 0 */
   {4, 5, 6, 7} ,   /*  initializers for row indexed by 1 */
   {8, 9, 10, 11}   /*  initializers for row indexed by 2 */
};
```

The nested braces, which indicate the intended row, are optional. The following initialization is equivalent to the previous example:

```c
int a[3][4] = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11};
```

### Accesing Two-dimensional Array elements

An element in a two-dimensional array is accessed by using the subscripts, i.e., row index and column index of the array.

```c
int val = a[2][3];
```

The above statement will take the 4th element from the 3rd row of the array. You can verify it in the above figure. Let us check the following program where we have used a nested loop to handle a two-dimensional array:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
 
int main () {

   /* an array with 5 rows and 2 columns*/
   int a[5][2] = { {0,0}, {1,2}, {2,4}, {3,6},{4,8}};
   int i, j;
 
   /* output each array element's value */
   for ( i = 0; i < 5; i++ ) {

      for ( j = 0; j < 2; j++ ) {
         printf("a[%d][%d] = %d\n", i,j, a[i][j] );
      }
   }
   
   return 0;
}
```
